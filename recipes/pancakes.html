            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for greasing the griddle or pan</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Maple syrup</li>
            <li>Fresh berries</li>
            <li>Sliced bananas</li>
            <li>Chopped nuts</li>
            <li>Whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Griddle or Pan:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Preheat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Grease it with a small amount of butter or oil.</li>
              </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Dry Ingredients:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps; overmixing can lead to dense pancakes.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Ladle 1/4 cup portions of batter onto the preheated griddle or pan, leaving enough space between each pancake.</li>
              <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes and the edges begin to look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Flip and Cook the Other Side:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Carefully flip each pancake with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Repeat:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Continue the process until all the batter is used, adding more butter or oil to the griddle as needed.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Stack the pancakes on a plate and top with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh berries, sliced bananas, chopped nuts, or whipped cream.</li>
            </ul><br>
